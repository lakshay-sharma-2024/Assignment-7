# Assignment-7
This Java program takes user input for two rational numbers, performs various operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them, and then displays the results. It also compares the two numbers, converts one of them to a floating-point value, and finds the absolute value of one of the numbers.
If either of the denominators is zero or if there's any issue with the input format (like non-integer inputs), it catches those errors and displays appropriate error messages.
This Java program prompts the user to input a number for which it calculates the factorial. It then computes the factorial of that number using a custom factorial calculation method from the Factorial class.
If there's any issue with the input format (like non-integer inputs) or if the factorial of a negative number is attempted, it catches those errors and displays appropriate error messages.
This Java program prompts the user to input a string. It then checks if the entered string is equal to the word "BooM" using a custom method from the checkStr class.
If the entered string doesn't match "BooM", it throws a NoMatchException, and the program catches this exception, displaying an error message along with the stack trace. However, the program seems to have a logical flaw because it always prints "The word entered is equal to BooM" regardless of the actual comparison result.
